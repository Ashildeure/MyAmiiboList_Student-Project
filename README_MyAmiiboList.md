# MyAmiiboList ‚Äì Web Application

## üöÄ About the Project
**MyAmiiboList** is a web application developed during the second year of the **BUT Informatique** program. It interfaces with the public [AmiiboAPI](https://www.amiiboapi.com/api), which provides detailed data about Nintendo Amiibo figurines and related products.

Created in a team of two, the goal of this project was to build a simple yet functional web interface that allows users to explore Amiibo figures, filter and search through them, and manage a personal collection.

## üéÆ Features
- **Full Amiibo Listing**: Dynamically displays all available Amiibo figures and related items.  
- **Filter Options**: Filter Amiibo by various criteria such as character, series, type, and more.  
- **Name-Based Search**: Search bar to find specific Amiibo by name.  
- **Favorites System**: Mark Amiibo as favorites for easier access.  
- **Personal Collection Tracking**: Keep track of which Amiibo you already own.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3**  
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**  
- **Fetch API** to retrieve data from the AmiiboAPI  
- **LocalStorage** for saving favorites and owned items locally

## üåü Learning Outcomes
This project allowed us to:  
- Deepen our understanding of JavaScript for DOM manipulation and data handling.  
- Learn how to consume and display data from a RESTful API.  
- Manage local application state using `localStorage`.  
- Structure a complete front-end application without external frameworks.  
- Collaborate effectively as a two-person development team.

## üí° Next Steps
If we continue working on this project, we would like to:  
- Make the interface responsive for mobile and tablet devices.  
- Add user authentication to sync favorites and collection data across devices.  
- Integrate sorting options (e.g., by release date, alphabetical order).  
- Enhance the UI with a modern design and animations.
